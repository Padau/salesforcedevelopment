What is an ecosystem for businesses? 
A Ecosystem for business is a network that fulfill the criterias: systainability (it thrives without outside influence), selfgovernace (doesn’t have top-down control) and evolution (it has the flexibility to change over time through competition and experimentation).
The ecosystem consists of businesses, consultants, and independent developers who build applications on top of the Salesforce platform. They are supported by the Salesforce team.
The idea is that each entity in the ecosystem affects and is affected by the others, creating a constantly evolving relationship in which each entity must be flexible and adaptable in order to survive as in a biological ecosystem.

What is a community for businesses? 
Using the “community onion” concept from the Keen.io team, you can visualize the layers of membership in your business:
  
Each of these member groups experience your community differently.
Internal Community: It is the team members. 
Customer Community:  This is what is traditionally considered ‘community’ at companies and what is most often the responsibility of a community manager or community team. Typically made up of customers,
External Community: The lines between external and customer community are constantly being blurred. External community tends to be something that marketing is more involved in, and is made up of the entire ‘network of engagement’ around an organization. This might include things like social media, webinars, newsletters, and other programs that can be community-led, while reaching both customers and potential-customers alike.
Market Community:The broader market in which a company exists, made up of other communities, and every person in their target market

Salesforce communities can bring all this layers together.
Salesforce communities are brand spaces that work to facilitate collaboration and connection for employees, business partners, and customers. It provides tools to benefit your business’s marketing efforts, commerce, service, and sales. This also frees up customer service teams to tackle tougher cases. Communities can also help deepen customer loyalty, with enthusiastic customers acting as 'evangelists' for the brand. Together this improves customer satisfaction levels.
Salesforce communities can be created within the CRM platform, providing a streamlined way to collaborate and share insight and information with the people who are within this community. The community are the crucial people to your business processes: employees, partners, and customers.
Salesforce’s customer communities function as self-service portals that offer FAQs, discussion pages, articles relevant to the products and services you offer, and process documentation. Partners to your company are also in need of a collaborative platform. Partner communities are an all-encompassing destination for resellers and sales teams. By creating a single portal that provides all of the necessary information, collaboration, and company data, partners can work more efficiently and accurately to close in on the best business opportunities. Employees often need to share information and files, retrieve and read company announcements and documents, as well as manage projects in one comprehensive portal.
